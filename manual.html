<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>D is an interactive compiler based on <small>FORTH</small>. It is implemented for
the PowerPC processor under Mac OS X.

<p>D is licensed under the <small>GNU</small> General Public License, see the file
<code>COPYING</code> for details.

<p>If you have any questions, comments, suggestions or bug reports
concerning D, feel free to write <a href="mailto:danengel@ee.ethz.ch">me</a>. Visit
the <a href="http://www.ee.ethz.ch/~danengel/d/">website</a> for the latest
release.

<h2>Why D?</h2>

<p>The main strengths of D are
<ul>
    <li><strong>interactivity</strong>: All steps (edit, compile, link,
execute) take place in the same environment. Code you type is compiled
before you can take your hands off the keyboard.

<li><strong>simplicity</strong>: D has one syntax rule and one data type.

<li><strong>speed</strong>: Compile 1500 lines in only 0.2 seconds (at 300
MHz).

<li><strong>empower</strong>: Do whatever you want without a complaining
compiler.

<li><strong>modifiability</strong>: You may change anything you want,
rewrite the compiler, assembler, interpreter, add new functionality or
structures.

<li>seamless integration of <strong>assembler</strong>: You may always
write in assembler, even in the middle of a function. 
</ul>

<h2>What you should know</h2>

<p>You should be familiar with the basic concepts of programming such as
variables, functions, loops, stacks and lists.

<p>It is not necessary to know <small>FORTH</small>. The basic structure of D is the
same, but many things are different, so learning <small>FORTH</small> would make
things rather complicated.

<p>D may be used without ever using the assembler, but you shouldn't be
afraid of it:
<ul>
        <li>Sometimes a job is done much easier in registers than on a
stack. 
        <li>Most of D is written in assembler. To understand D's inner
workings, there's no way around assembler. 
</ul>

<p>Because D doesn't perform (almost) any error-checking, it's easy to
create a big mess in no time. D requires you to think a little more than
other languages, I hope you like that.

<h2>Launching D</h2>

<p>In the Terminal, go to D's directory. Type

<p align="center"><kbd>./D all.d</kbd></p>

<p>after which you should see a welcome message and a prompt <code>&gt;&gt;</code>
where you can enter your code.

<p>You could launch D with just <kbd>./D</kbd>, but that loads only the kernel
with which you can't do many things. The file <code>all.d</code> loads all
sources to compile everything you need.

<br>

<h2>The stack</h2>

<p>D's most important element is the <dfn>stack</dfn> upon which all operations
take place. A stack is a first-in-last-out structure, you can put an
item on top of others and take it away later.

<p>We describe a stack by naming all items left-to-right in parentheses. An
empty stack is denoted by <code>( )</code>, if we add a 3, it becomes <code>(
3 )</code>. After putting a 7 to it, it is <code>( 3 7 )</code>. If you take away
one item, you get back 7 and the stack is <code>( 3 )</code>.

<p>To add two numbers (e.g. 3 and 7), we put them on the stack <code>( 3 7
)</code> and call <code>+</code>, which leaves the result <code>( 10 )</code>. To
denote what <code>+</code> does we indicate its stack effect as <code>( n1
n2 -- sum )</code> which means it takes two numbers <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code>,
does something and leaves one number <code>sum</code>.

<p>If you've forgotten the stack effect of <code>+</code>, type <code>explain
+</code>

<p>Other operations are <code>dup</code> <code>( n -- n n )</code> which duplicates
one item, or <code>drop</code> <code>( n -- )</code> which throws one item away.

<br>

<h2>Words</h2>

<p>In D, everything is a <dfn>word</dfn>. There is no difference between a
function, variable, constant, class or anything the like. You can, of
course, use variables, it's just that they're not handled differently
than other words.

<p>So, how is a word handled? You simply call it by its name, after which
it's executed. Let me give you some examples:
<ul>
        <li><code>bye</code> quits D. 
        <li><code>+</code> takes two numbers, adds them and leaves the
result. 
        <li><code>.</code> takes one number and prints it. 
</ul>

<p>Fine, but what about variables? If you call the variable <code>foo</code>,
it leaves the address of a cell in memory. To set <code>foo</code> to 88,
type

<p align="center"><kbd>variable foo</kbd></p>

<p align="center"><kbd>88 foo !</kbd></p>

<p>The <code>!</code> takes a number (88 in this case) and an address
(<code>foo</code>'s) and stores the number at the address, so the stack
effect of <code>!</code> is <code>( n a -- )</code>. 
Calling <code>@</code> <code>( a -- n )</code> fetches what's in a variable. Try

<p align="center"><kbd>foo @ .</kbd></p>

<p>A word can have any name. All characters except spaces are allowed, so
valid names would be <code>(hel!lo</code> or <code>#@</code> or <code>%foo/bar</code>.

<br>

<h2>The Dictionary</h2>

<p>All words are stored in a list called the <dfn>dictionary</dfn>. The list
starts with the latest word and ends with the first.

<p>When you create a new word, it's added as the latest word. Because of
this rule, words must be created in order of dependence, i.e. no word
can use another which is created later. Usually this results in complex
(later) words which build upon simple (early) ones.

<p>When you type <code>+</code> to add two numbers, D searches the dictionary
for it and executes the code which belongs to <code>+</code>. If you type
<kbd>it</kbd>, D complains <code>What is "it"?</code> because there is no such
word.

<h2>Reading Files</h2>

<p>D can read files using the word <code>learn</code>. For example,
<code>learn assembler.d</code> reads the file <code>assembler.d</code> as if you
entered it manually. The file name extension <code>.d</code> is just a
convention and not necessary.

<p>To avoid reading a file twice, <code>?learn</code> may be used instead of
<code>learn</code>. Using <code>?learn</code>, a file is read only if no word
with the same name as the file already exists. To make use of this,
begin the file <code>foobar.d</code> with <code>: foobar.d ;</code>

<p>A file may be read at startup by launching D with <kbd>./D foobar.d</kbd>

<br>

<h2>Counted Loops</h2>

<p>Counted loops can be compiled using <code>do</code> and
<code>loop</code>. When running, <code>do</code> pops a number from the stack,
the number of repetitions.

<pre>: tell 5 do ." Hello World!\n" loop ;
tell
</pre>

<p>The current loop counter can be accessed with <code>i</code>:

<pre>: count ( n -- ) do i . BL loop ;
10 count
</pre>

<p>Loops count backwards because the count register (<small>CTR</small>) is used. If
you need to count forward, you have severeal options:

<ul>
<li>For simple loops, count a value on the stack.
<pre>: hundred ( -- ) 100   10 do dup . BL   1 + loop   drop ;
hundred
</pre>
The number 100 is incremented each time at the end of the loop.

<li>For complex loops, count a local:
<pre>: hundred { - n -- }
    100 =&gt; n
    10 do n . BL   inc&gt; n loop ;
hundred
</pre>

<li>Another way is to subtract <code>i</code> from a value:
<pre>: hundred ( -- ) 10 do 110 i - . BL loop ;
hundred
</pre>
</ul>

<p>If a loop is inside another, <code>j</code> gets you the outer counter:
<pre>: double ( -- ) 5 do 3 do j . BL loop LF loop ;
double
</pre>

<h3>Advanced</h3>

<p>Before a loop is entered, the count register (<small>CTR</small>) is saved on the
system stack because every word must leave it unchanged. The top stack
item is then loaded into <small>CTR</small>. At the end of the loop, a
<code>bdnz</code>-instruction decrements it and jumps back.

<p>To get the current <small>CTR</small>, <code>i</code> simply pushes it on the stack,
<code>j</code> reads the top cell on the system stack. If there is no outer
loop, <code>j</code> is just garbage. If there is no loop at all,
<code>i</code> makes no sense too.

<p>I'm not really happy with backward counting loops, but it is simple and
straightforward. Changing all loops to count upwards by default can be
done, of course.

<h2>Conditional Loops</h2>

<p>There are two types of conditional loops:
<code>begin</code>-<code>until</code> and <code>begin</code>-<code>again</code>.

<p>You need to cancel this by Control-C:
<pre>: forever ( -- ) begin ." oh no! " again ;
forever
</pre>

<p>This one has the same effect:
<pre>: forever ( -- ) begin ." oh no!" 1 until ;
forever
</pre>

<p><code>until</code> pops a flag from the stack, if it's true, it jumps to
<code>begin</code>, otherwise it leaves the loop. Thus, the following
executes only once.

<pre>: forever ( -- ) begin ." oh no!" 0 until ;
forever
</pre>

<br>

<h2>Locals</h2>

<p>A stack is fine for many operations but sometimes it's better to use
<dfn>locals</dfn>. They are like variables which are visible only in the
current definition. Because they use registers, very efficient code is
generated.

<p>Up to 9 locals can be defined in a word. Normally, they're used to hold
input paramters:

<p><code>: tree { count x } ( ... ) ;</code>

<p>When calling <code>4 5 tree</code>, <code>count</code> and <code>x</code> hold the values
4 and 5.

<p>If you need a local which should not be loaded with input parameters,
e.g. for an intermediate result, you may use

<p><code>: tree { count x - temp } ( ... ) ;</code>

<p>The dash "-" tells D that the following words should not be loaded
initially, so they're value is undefined (not zero) first.

<p>Anything after "<code>--</code>" is ignored to make a local definition look
like a stack comment:

<p><code>: tree { count x - temp -- ignore me } ( ... ) ;</code>

<p>Because locals are stored in registers (as opposed to variables which
reside in memory) the syntax to handle them is a little different:
<pre>: swap { a b } b a ; ( Fetch a local by entering its name )

: foo { - x } 5 =&gt; x   x ; ( Store 5 in x and fetch it )

: bar { a - me } 4 ++&gt; a ; ( Add 4 to a )

: nice { - x -- out } clear&gt; x inc&gt; x ; ( Clear, then increment x by 1 )
</pre>

<p>Locals can be used in assembler, too. Use <code>` n</code> to get the
register number of <code>n</code>:

<pre>: invert { n -- n }
    [ t0 -1 li , ] ( set t0 = -1 )
    [ ` n dup t0 xor , ] ( xor t0 and n )
    n ;
#11110000 invert #.
</pre>

<h3>Advanced</h3>

<p>Some of the 32 general purpose registers are used as local variables,
currently <code>s0</code>-<code>s8</code>. For more about register usage see
<a href="#Registers">Registers</a>.

<p>For every local that can be used, a (initially non-named) word
exists. Their addresses are stored in the array <code>locals</code>. Each of
these words has a register number stored at a fixed offset
(<code>&gt;{#}</code>) from the word address.

<p>When creating locals with e.g. <code>{ alpha bar - x }</code>, each name is
assigned one of the words in <code>locals</code>. In this case,
<code>alpha</code> would be the first (<code>s0</code>, <code>bar</code> the second
<code>s1</code>, and so on.

<p>To work with locals, their register numbers are needed. This is what the
local tick <code>`</code> (not <code>'</code>) is good for: It returns the number
stored at the offset <code>&gt;{#}</code>, which is the register by
definition. Commands such as <code>=&gt;</code>, <code>++&gt;</code> use <code>`</code> to
compile their according instructions.

<p>See the file <code>locals.d</code> for additional information, e.g. about how
to write new handling words such as <code>=&gt;</code>.

<br>

<h2>Explanations</h2>

<p>Because it is difficult to remember the stack effects of all words, and
sometimes you may even forget the meaning of one, an explanation
mechanism is a built-in feature of D.

<p>To explain a word, enter <code>explain</code> followed by the name of the
word (e.g. <code>explain words</code>). Most words describe only their stack
effect, a few (such as <code>(:)</code> tell you more, some have no
explanation.

<p>To provide explanations about general topics or a group of similar
words, you may use words beginning with <code>??-</code>. These words contain
only an explanation and no code. The advantage of the <code>??-</code> naming
convention is that you can enter <code>explain ??-</code> followed by the
<kbd>TAB</kbd>-key which lists all such words.

<p>When defining a new word, you can include an explanation:
<pre>: hot-new-word ?" ( n1 n1 -- n3 ) I am so cool!" dup rot over ( anything more ) ;
</pre>
Try <code>explain hot-new-word</code>.

<p>The "explained"-bit of the flags of a word is set if an explanation is
provided.

<li><dfn>Cell</dfn>: 32 bits (or 4 bytes). The basic (and only) data
type. A cell in memory must be 4-byte-aligned. 
<li><dfn>String</dfn>: Any zero-terminated sequence of bytes. 
<li><dfn>Blank</dfn>: A space, tab, linefeed or carriage return. 
<li><dfn>Name</dfn>: Any sequence of bytes enclosed by blanks. 
<li><dfn>Word</dfn>: As an expression, a word of D. As a numerical quantity
(e.g. in the stack effect of <code>&gt;name ( word -- str ))</code> the address
of the link field of a word. 
<li><dfn>Flag</dfn>: A value of 0 means false, any other means true. 
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Input</h2>

<p>D features a <strong>word-completing</strong> mechanism to save time when
writing code. It works the same as filename-completion in the shell: You
type the first characters of a name and press the <kbd>TAB</kbd>-key. If the
beginning of the name is unique, it is completed, otherwise all
possibilities are listed.

<p><strong>Escape sequences</strong> are handy to enter special characters:
<code>\n</code> (newline), <code>\t</code> (tab) and <code>\\</code> (backslash) do the
same as in C. Escape sequences can always be used (not only in strings
as in C). So <code>:\tfoo\n;</code> looks ugly, but works.

<br>

<h2>Stack caching</h2>

<p>In traditional <small>FORTH</small>-implementations, the stack resides in memory
and all operations are performed in memory.  Because the PowerPC is
based on a load-process-store architecture, moving stack cells from
memory to registers and back is a tideous procedure which requires a lot
of instructions and time.  Also, we have 32 registers to waste (compared
to only a few in the earlier days), so why not make use of them?

<p>Thus, three registers (<code>c0</code>, <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code>) are provided
for caching the stack. If one cell is cached, it looks like <code>( c0
)</code>, with two it's <code>( c0 c1 )</code> and with three it's <code>( c0 c1 c2
)</code>. You can imagine the cache as a real stack "growing" downwards from
<code>c0</code> to <code>c2</code>.

<p>To make use of the cache, a word can have up to four parts: One which is
used when the cache is empty, one if there is one cell in the cache, and
so on. Most words only use one part, e.g. the dot <code>. ( n -- )</code>
requires one cell in the cache. Primitive words such as <code>dup</code>,
<code>drop</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>!</code> use more than one part because
they're used very frequently and should thus be optimized,

<p>For example, <code>+ ( n1 n2 -- sum )</code> has two parts, for two and three
cells. Their stack effects are <code>( c0 c1 -- c0+c1 )</code> part for two
cells and <code>( c0 c1 c2 -- c0 c1+c2 )</code> for three.

<p>If a word is to be executed which doesn't match the current number of
cached cells, the cache is automatically adjusted. For example, calling
<code>+</code> when no cells are cached causes two items to be loaded
first.

<p>When defining a word, you can indicate it's cache count on entry using
<code>:</code> (no cells cached), <code>1:</code> (one cell cached) etc.

<p>Defining a word such as <code>+</code> with multiple parts is a bit more
difficult:
<pre>create +   inline
    2 0 (:) [ c0 c0 c1 add ,   1 - ] (;)
    3 0 (:) [ c1 c1 c2 add ,   1 - ] ;
</pre>
<code>inline</code> means when compiling <code>+</code>, it's code can be
inserted directly (normally a subroutine call is generated).

<p><code>(:)</code> takes two arguments, the cache count for the current part
and the numbers of local variables used (0 in this case). <code>(;)</code>
finishes a part, <code>;</code> the word.

<p><code>[</code> enters the assembler and leaves the cache count on the
stack. Before leaving the assembler with <code>]</code>, we decrement the
cache count (using <code>1 -</code>) because <code>+</code> leaves one item less
than it takes.

<p>Compiling words (<code>literal</code>, <code>word,</code> etc.) deal with the
stack cache, thus appropriate information must be passed to and from
these words. Usually <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> in the stack effect are
used as the stack count entry and exit. For example, <code>literal</code>
returns <code>out</code>=<code>in</code>+1 because it pushes a number on the stack
cache.

<h2>Words and the Dictionary</h2>

<p>The dictionary actually consists of two parts: the data and the
instruction dictionary. The reason for this lies in the way the PowerPC
processor distinguishes data and instructions (Harvard architecture) and
is mainly for speed and simplicity. You don't need to care about this
except when writing new defining words such as <code>variable</code>.

<p>A word uses a continuous space in both dictionaries. The data part
contains in this order:
<ul>
<li>Link field (one cell): Address of the next (older) word. The last
word terminates the list with zero.

<li>Flags (one cell): Bit 8 = inline, bit 7 = immediate, bit 6 = leaf,
bit 5 = explained. The least significant byte (bits 24-31) contains the
cache count on exit of the different parts: bits 30/31 for 0 items, bits
28/29 for one etc.

<li>Code addresses (4 cells): A code address of a part is zero if no
such part is provided. E.g. The code addresses of <code>+</code> are 0, 0,
(address of part 2) and (address of part 3).

<li>Name (String followed by 4 byte-alignment)
<li>Explanation (String followed by 4 byte-alignment)
</ul>

<p>The instruction part contains -- of course -- instructions.

<h2>Assembler</h2>

<p>The file <code>assembler.d</code> contains a complete PowerPC-assembler with
all standard mnemonics, including simplified. There's no AltiVec-support
yet because my iBook is a good old G3. Don't use labels, there aren't
any. Most of the time they're not necessary anyway and bad programming
practice.

<p>The heart of the assembler are instructions. As you would expect, input
is reversed to the rest of the world. For example, the PowerPC
specifications tell you to write <code>addic. r4, r5, 99</code>, but with D
it's <code>r4 r5 99 addic.</code>

<p>An instruction such as <code>addic.</code> generates a number which can be
compiled using the comma <code>,</code>

<p>An advantage of this seperation (instruction generating and compiling)
is that instructions can be modified later, which is used heavily in the
assembler itself. For example, there are many instructions with an
optional dot, such as <code>add</code>. Instead of redefining the whole
instruction, we use <code>: add. add Rc ;</code> where <code>Rc</code> sets the
"record carry" bit.

<p>While compiling, the assembler can be entered using <code>[</code> and is
left with <code>]</code>. <code>[</code> leaves the cache count and must be
updated before <code>]</code>, otherwise you mess up the word.

<h2>Numbers</h2>

<p>You know already that when you enter a number, it's put on the stack. In
detail, it works like that: Everything you enter is first considered as
the name of word and searched for in the dictionary. If you enter
<code>15</code> the search fails. Now D tries to convert <code>15</code> into a
number, which results in the number 15 on the stack.

<p>If you enter something that's neither a word nor a number, D doesn't
know what to do and generates an error.

<p>The variable <code>base</code> holds the current base for number
conversion. <kbd>10 3 base ! . abort</kbd> prints 10 with base 3 and resets
to base 10.

<p>No floating-point capability is around (except you do it in assembler),
because I don't know how to implement it efficiently. If you have a good
idea, tell me.

<h2>Strings</h2>

<p>Because strings are a somewhat ugly datatype, only basic string handling
is provided. Strings can be used only when defining words.
<pre>: hello ( -- )
    ." Hi there!\nD is nice, isn't it?" ;
</pre>

<pre>: simple ( -- str ) " Hello world" ;
( leaves the address of a string )
simple type

<h2>The Kernel</h2>

<p>The kernel holds the basic dictionary with the necessary words to build
an assembler (which follows in <code>assembler.d</code>). Once we have an
assembler, anything else can be done.

<p>The file <code>kernel.s</code> can be compiled using the following shell
commands:

<pre>sed -f ugly.sed kernel.s &gt; kernel~.s;
cc -framework CoreServices kernel~.s -lreadline -o D;
strip D;
rm kernel~.s;
